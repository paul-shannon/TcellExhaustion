* discussion section

  In this study, we define for the first time the chromatin state dynamics underlying tumor-specific T cell dysfunction
  over the course of tumorigenesis. Naïve tumor-specific T cells (TST) encountering tumor antigen in pre-malignant
  lesions differentiated to an initially plastic, therapeutically reprogrammable chromatin state, then transitioned to a
  fixed dysfunctional chromatin state that did not undergo further remodeling, even with progression to large
  established tumors (Extended Data Fig. 10e).

  The rapid induction of dysfunction early during tumorigenesis without progression through an effector
  state resembles peripheral tolerance induction. We identified core elements shared between murine fixed
  dysfunctional TST and human PD1hi TIL.

  Surprisingly, memory TST differentiated to the same fixed dysfunctional chromatin state in tumors, suggesting that
  antigen exposure in tumors can overwrite pre-existing epigenetic programs regardless of the initial differentiation
  state.  We identified surface markers, including CD101 and CD38, which were associated with discrete dysfunctional
  chromatin states and demarcated reprogrammable from non-reprogrammable PD1hi T cells within heterogeneous TIL
  populations, a finding of important potential clinical relevance, and human PD1hi TIL showed heterogeneous expression
  of these markers. In patients who do not respond to immune checkpoint blockade (non-responders), PD1hi TIL may be in
  a fixed dysfunctional state, in contrast to responders whose PD1hi TIL are in a plastic state, amenable to
  reprogramming. Our studies on the epigenetic and transcriptional programs underlying TST dysfunctional states and
  therapeutic reprogrammability point to new targets and strategies to transform TST into potent anti-tumor agents.

* peripheral tolerance induction, prevents autoimmune disease: scheitinger 2012

  Rescued Tolerant CD8 T Cells Are Preprogrammed to Reestablish the Tolerant State

  Tolerant self-antigen–specific CD8 T cells fail to proliferate in response to antigen, thereby preventing autoimmune
  disease. By using an in vivo mouse model, we show that tolerant T cells proliferate and become functional under
  lymphopenic conditions, even in a tolerogenic environment. However, T cell rescue is only transient, with tolerance
  reimposed upon lymphorepletion even in the absence of tolerogen (self-antigen), challenging the prevailing paradigm
  that continuous antigen exposure is critical to maintain tolerance. Genome-wide messenger RNA and microRNA profiling
  revealed that tolerant T cells have a tolerance-specific gene profile that can be temporarily overridden under
  lymphopenic conditions but is inevitably reimposed, which suggests epigenetic regulation. These insights into the
  regulatory mechanisms that maintain or break self-tolerance may lead to new strategies for the treatment of cancer and
  autoimmunity.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* cd8: CD8+ (cytotoxic) T cells, like CD4+ Helper T cells, are generated in the thymus and express the T-cell
  receptor. However, rather than the CD4 molecule, cytotoxic T cells express a dimeric co-receptor, CD8, usually
  composed of one CD8α and one CD8β chain. CD8+ T cells recognise peptides presented by MHC Class I molecules, found on
  all nucleated cells. The CD8 heterodimer binds to a conserved portion (the α3 region) of MHC Class I during T
  cell/antigen presenting cell interactions (see Figure 1).

  CD8+ T cells (often called cytotoxic T lymphocytes, or CTLs) are very important for immune defence against
  intracellular pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, and for tumour surveillance. When a CD8+ T cell recognises
  its antigen and becomes activated, it has three major mechanisms to kill infected or malignant cells. The first is
  secretion of cytokines, primarily TNF-α and IFN-γ, which have anti-tumour and anti-viral microbial effects.
  
  CD8 (cluster of differentiation 8) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that serves as a co-receptor for the T cell
  receptor (TCR). Like the TCR, CD8 binds to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, but is specific for the
  class I MHC protein.[2] There are two isoforms of the protein, alpha and beta, each encoded by a different gene. In
  humans, both genes are located on chromosome 2 in position 2p12.

  The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface
  for recognition by the appropriate T-cells.[1] MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes, also called white
  blood cells (WBCs), which are immune cells, with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines compatibility
  of donors for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to an autoimmune disease via crossreacting
  immunization. The human MHC is also called the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) complex (often just the HLA).

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* thymus

  the thymus is a specialized primary lymphoid organ of the immune system. Within the thymus, T cells mature. T cells
  are critical to the adaptive immune system, where the body adapts specifically to foreign invaders. The thymus is
  composed of two identical lobes and is located anatomically in the anterior superior mediastinum, in front of the
  heart and behind the sternum. Histologically, each lobe of the thymus can be divided into a central medulla and a
  peripheral cortex which is surrounded by an outer capsule. The cortex and medulla play different roles in the
  development of T cells. Cells in the thymus can be divided into thymic stromal cells and cells of hematopoietic origin
  (derived from bone marrow resident hematopoietic stem cells). Developing T cells are referred to as thymocytes and are
  of hematopoietic origin. Stromal cells include epithelial cells of the thymic cortex and medulla, and dendritic cells.

  The thymus provides an inductive environment for development of T cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells. In
  addition, thymic stromal cells allow for the selection of a functional and self-tolerant T cell repertoire. Therefore,
  one of the most important roles of the thymus is the induction of central tolerance.

  The thymus is largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods. By the early teens, the thymus
  begins to atrophy and thymic stroma is mostly replaced by adipose (fat) tissue. Nevertheless, residual T lymphopoiesis
  continues throughout adult life.

* immune checkpoint, checkpoint blockade

  schietinger 2017 abstract: 

    Tumour-specific CD8 T cells in solid tumours are dysfunctional, allowing tumours to progress. The epigenetic
    regulation of T cell dysfunction and therapeutic reprogrammability (for example, to immune checkpoint blockade) is
    not well understood.

  s2017.intro: the clinical success of immune checkpoint blockade (PD1/PDL1, CTLA4 blocking antibodies) and adoptive
  T cell terapy in a subset of cancer patients demonstrates the great potential of TST (of tumor-specific cd8 T cells).
  
  Immune checkpoint blockade removes inhibitory signals of T-cell activation, which enables tumor-reactive T cells to
  overcome regulatory mechanisms and mount an effective antitumor response (1–3). Such regulatory mechanisms normally
  maintain immune responses within a desired physiologic range and protect the host from autoimmunity.

  Immune checkpoints are regulators of the immune system. These pathways are crucial for self-tolerance, which prevents
  the immune system from attacking cells indiscriminately.

  Inhibitory checkpoint molecules are targets for cancer immunotherapy due to their potential for use in multiple types
  of cancers. Currently approved checkpoint inhibitors block CTLA4 and PD-1 and PD-L1. For the related basic science
  discoveries, James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo won the Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science and the Nobel Prize in
  Physiology or Medicine in 2018


*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* PD1 with ligand PDL1 

  PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is known to drive T cell dysfunction, which can be blocked by anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies.

  PD-1 is a checkpoint protein on immune cells called T cells. It normally acts as a type of “off switch” that helps
  keep the T cells from attacking other cells in the body. It does this when it attaches to PD-L1, a protein on some
  normal (and cancer) cells. When PD-1 binds to PD-L1, it basically tells the T cell to leave the other cell alone. Some
  cancer cells have large amounts of PD-L1, which helps them evade immune attack.

  Monoclonal antibodies that target either PD-1 or PD-L1 can block this binding and boost the immune response against
  cancer cells. These drugs have shown a great deal of promise in treating certain cancers.



  Ligation of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1, also known as CD279) with PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1, also called
  B7-H1 or CD274) activates a critical immune checkpoint leading to T cell dysfunction, exhaustion, and
  tolerance; high-affinity anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which block PD-1–PD-L1 interaction,
  can reverse the immune checkpoint, releasing the brake on T cell responses. However, neither PD-1 nor PD-L1 expression
  is specific for the reversible T cell dysfunction state, and the effect of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade can be
  context-dependent. In addition, PD-1 signaling and the mechanism of action of anti-PD-1/L1 mAbs are not completely
  understood.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* CTL4A

  CTLA4 or CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4), also known as CD152 (cluster of differentiation 152),
  is a protein receptor that functions as an immune checkpoint and downregulates immune responses. CTLA4 is
  constitutively expressed in regulatory T cells but only upregulated in conventional T cells after activation – a
  phenomenon which is particularly notable in cancers.[4] It acts as an "off" switch when bound to CD80 or CD86 on the
  surface of antigen-presenting cells.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TST tummor-specific T cells

    TOX is a critical regulator of tumour-specific T cell differentiation [scheitinger 2019 nature]

  Tumour-specific CD8 T cell dysfunction is a differentiation state that is distinct from the functional effector or
  memory T cell states1,2,3,4,5,6. Here we identify the nuclear factor TOX as a crucial regulator of the
  differentiation of tumour-specific T (TST) cells. We show that TOX is highly expressed in dysfunctional TST cells
  from tumours and in exhausted T cells during chronic viral infection. Expression of TOX is driven by chronic T cell
  receptor stimulation and NFAT activation. Ectopic expression of TOX in effector T cells in vitro induced a
  transcriptional program associated with T cell exhaustion. Conversely, deletion of Tox in TST cells in tumours
  abrogated the exhaustion program: Tox-deleted TST cells did not upregulate genes for inhibitory receptors (such as
  Pdcd1, Entpd1, Havcr2, Cd244 and Tigit), the chromatin of which remained largely inaccessible, and retained high
  expression of transcription factors such as TCF-1. Despite their normal, ‘non-exhausted’ immunophenotype, Tox-deleted
  TST cells remained dysfunctional, which suggests that the regulation of expression of inhibitory receptors is
  uncoupled from the loss of effector function. Notably, although Tox-deleted CD8 T cells differentiated normally to
  effector and memory states in response to acute infection, Tox-deleted TST cells failed to persist in tumours. We
  hypothesize that the TOX-induced exhaustion program serves to prevent the overstimulation of T cells and
  activation-induced cell death in settings of chronic antigen stimulation such as cancer.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* non-responsive TST:  heritable dysfunctional state epigenetically imprinted  s.2007.intro

  We previously demonstrated that early during tumorigenesis, TST become non-responsive, exhibiting the phenotypic,
  functional, and transcriptional features of tumor-reactive tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from late-stage human
  solid tumors6. TST dysfunction is initially reversible but ultimately becomes irreversible, even after removal of
  dysfunctional T cells from the tumor microenvironment and multiple rounds of cell division6. We hypothesized that this
  heritable, signal-independent dysfunctional state is epigenetically imprinted.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* TAG:  SV40 large T antigen  binds, sequesters, inactivates P53

   SV40 large T antigen (Simian Vacuolating Virus 40 TAg) is a hexamer protein that is a dominant-acting oncoprotein
   derived from the polyomavirus SV40. TAg is capable of inducing malignant transformation of a variety of cell
   types. The transforming activity of TAg is due in large part to its perturbation of the retinoblastoma (pRb)[1] and
   p53 tumor suppressor proteins.[2] In addition, TAg binds to several other cellular factors, including the
   transcriptional co-activators p300 and CBP, which may contribute to its transformation function.[3]

   TAg is a product of an early gene transcribed during viral infection by SV40, and is involved in viral genome
   replication and regulation of host cell cycle. SV40 is a double-stranded, circular DNA virus belonging to the
   Polyomaviridae (earlier Papovavirus) family, Orthopolyomavirus genus. Polyomaviruses infect a wide variety of
   vertebrates and cause solid tumours at multiple sites. SV40 was isolated by Sweet and Maurice Hilleman in 1960 in
   primary monkey kidney cell cultures being used to grow Sabin OPV.[4]


   The SV40 large T antigen-p53 complexes bind and activate the insulin-like growth factor-I promoter stimulating cell growth.
   
   Inactivation of cellular p53 is a crucial step in carcinogenesis. Accordingly, p53 is inactivated in most human
   cancers by different mechanisms. In cells infected with DNA tumor viruses, p53 is bound to the viral tumor antigens
   (Tag). The current "dogma" views the Tag-p53 complexes as a way of sequestering and inactivating p53. Using primary
   human cells and SV40-transformed human cells, we show that in addition to inactivating p53 tumor suppressor
   activities, the Tag-p53 complex has growth stimulatory activities that are required for malignant cell growth. We
   found that in human cells, Tag-p53 complexes regulate transcription of the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) gene
   by binding to the IGF-I promoter together with pRb and p300. Depletion of p53 leads to structural rearrangements of
   this multiprotein complex, resulting in IGF-I promoter transcriptional repression and growth arrest. Our data provide
   a novel mechanistic and biological interpretation of the p53-Tag complexes and of DNA tumor virus transformation in
   general. In the model we propose, p53 is not a passive inactive partner of Tag. Instead the p53-Tag complex promotes
   malignant cell growth through its ability to activate the IGF-I signaling pathway.




   SV40 large T antigen-specific human T cell memory responses.   J Med Virol. 2008 Aug

   The continued presence of simian virus 40 (SV40), a monkey polyomavirus, in man is confirmed by the regular detection
   of SV40-specific antibodies in 5-10% of children who are unlikely to have received contaminated polio-vaccines. The
   aim of our experiments was to find cellular immunological evidence of SV40 infection in humans by testing memory T
   cell responses to SV40 large T antigen (Tag).

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* congenic

  Congenic strains are generated in the laboratory by mating two inbred strains (usually rats or mice), and
  back-crossing the descendants 5–10 generations with one of the original strains, known as the recipient
  strain. Typically selection for either phenotype or genotype is performed prior to each back-cross generation. In this
  manner either an interesting phenotype, or a defined chromosomal region assayed by genotype, is passed from the donor
  strain onto an otherwise uniform recipient background. Congenic mice or rats can then be compared to the pure
  recipient strain to determine whether they are phenotypically different if selection was for a genotypic region, or to
  identify the critical genetic locus, if selection was for a phenotype.

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SV40

  SV40 consists of an unenveloped icosahedral virion with a closed circular dsDNA genome[18] of 5.2 kb.[19] The virion
  adheres to cell surface receptors of MHC class I by the virion glycoprotein VP1. Penetration into the cell is through
  a caveolin vesicle. Inside the cell nucleus, the cellular RNA polymerase II acts to promote early gene
  expression. This results in an mRNA that is spliced into two segments. The small and large T antigens result from
  this. The large T antigen has two functions: 5% goes to the plasma cell membrane and 95% returns to the nucleus. Once
  in the nucleus the large T antigen binds three viral DNA sites, I, II and III. Binding of sites I and II autoregulates
  early RNA synthesis. Binding to site II takes place in each cell cycle. Binding site I initiates DNA replication at
  the origin of replication. Early transcription gives two spliced RNAs that are both 19s. Late transcription gives both
  a longer 16s, which synthesizes the major viral capsid protein VP1; and the smaller 19s, which gives VP2 and VP3
  through leaky scanning. All of the proteins, besides the 5% of large T, return to the nucleus because assembly of the
  viral particle happens there. Eventual release of the viral particles is cytolytic and results in cell death.

* T-antigen transgenic mouse models: SV40 T antigen mimics tumorigenic processes

  T-antigen transgenic mouse models

  Two major very exciting areas of scientific research came together in the early 1980s and resulted in the production
  of models to investigate cancer. On one hand, the technology to produce transgenic mice was being developed rapidly
  and, at the same time, many viral and cellular oncogenes were being discovered and subsequently cloned. It soon
  became evident that the expression of SV40 sequences including the large T antigen (T antigen) in mice resulted in
  tumor development in particular tissues [2, 3]. Up until that point cancer models had been based on cell lines
  obtained from human or animal tumors and maintained in tissue culture, or from the subcutaneous inoculation of those
  cells into immunodeficient mice. Although obviously useful, these models did not offer a good approach to
  understanding the genetics and the molecular pathways involved in different types of tumorigenesis, nor to the
  relevance to particular tumors and their site of origin “in vivo”. The arrival of transgenic mice expressing T antigen
  made clear, not only that T antigen expression was capable of driving resting cells into active proliferation status,
  but also that this trait was hereditary and the mouse progeny presented cancer predisposition. As a result, SV40 T
  antigen has been expressed in multiple tissues of transgenic mice to mimic tumorigenic processes.

* T cell types:  naive, effector, memory?

  excellent summary: T cell responses: naïve to memory and everything in between: 2013
  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089090/
  
  the major advantages of an adaptive response to the host are twofold. First, it allows the host to form an immune
  response that is specifically tailored to the invading pathogen. Second, it forms a pool of memory cells from these
  specific effectors that can last for many years, capable of protecting the host against reinfection by their rapid
  response.

   We transferred congenically-marked naïve (N; CD44lo CD62Lhi) TCRTAG from TCRTAG transgenic mice (specific for SV40
   large T antigen epitope I (TAG)) into wild-type C57BL/6 mice, which were immunized one day later with recombinant
   Listeria monocytogenes strain expressing TAG (LmTAG)6,13. TCRTAG were re-isolated, phenotypically and functionally
   characterized, and subjected to ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq

     We next assessed chromatin state dynamics in TST over the course of tumorigenesis using the previously described
     tamoxifen (Tam)-inducible, autochthonous liver cancer model in which TAG is a tumor-specific antigen.

     We transferred congenically-marked naïve TCRTAG (N, identical to N in Fig. 1a) into ASTxCre-ERT2 mice 1 day prior
     to Tam and then analyzed TCRTAG at different time points (Fig. 2a).

     We tested whether accessibility of potential TF targets changed preferentially during differentiation from N to L5 as compared to N to E5

* autochthonous liver cancer model

   Autochthonous liver tumors induce systemic T cell tolerance associated with T cell receptor down-modulation.
   Hepatology. 2009 Mar;49(3):1058.

   The reason the adaptive immune system fails in advanced liver tumors is largely unclear. To address this question, we
   have developed a novel murine model that combines c-myc-induced autochthonous tumorigenesis with expression of a
   cognate antigen, ovalbumin (OVA). When c-myc/OVA transgenic mice were crossed with liver-specific inducer mice,
   multifocal hepatocellular carcinomas co-expressing OVA developed in a tetracycline-dependent manner with a short
   latency and 100% penetrance. Transferred OVA-specific T cells, although infiltrating the tumor at high numbers, were
   hyporesponsive, as evidenced by a lack of in vivo cytotoxicity and interferon gamma production. This allowed the
   tumor to progress even in the presence of large numbers of antigen-specific T cells and even after vaccination
   (OVA+CpG-DNA). Interestingly, T cell receptor down-modulation was observed, which may explain antigen-specific
   hyporesponsiveness. This model is helpful in understanding liver cancer-specific mechanisms of T cell tolerance and
   dissection of antigen-specific and nonspecific mechanisms of immunotherapies in the preclinical phase.

* autochthonous: (of an inhabitant of a place) indigenous rather than descended from migrants or colonists.

  geology: (of a deposit or formation) formed in its present position.

  autocthon (wikipedia):

    in Ancient Greece, the concept of autochthones (from Ancient Greek αὐτός autos "self," and χθών khthon "soil";
    i.e. "people sprung from earth itself") means the original inhabitants of a country as opposed to settlers, and
    those of their descendants who kept themselves free from an admixture of foreign peoples.

    In mythology, autochthones are those mortals who have sprung from the soil, rocks and trees. They are rooted and belong to the land eternally.

    An autochthon is not the same as the offspring of Gaia, called gegenes (earth-born), although later the terms have
    been conflated.  Ancient myth of autochthony in historiography is the belief of the historian or the tribe itself,
    that they were indigenous, the first humans to inhabit their possessed land. The term occurs firstly in 5th century
    BC ethnographic passages.
